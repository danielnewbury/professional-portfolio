## Daily Entries

### December 6, 2025 - Day 1: Foundation

**What I Did:**
- Created professional GitHub account (danielnewbury)
- Set up profile with photo and bio
- Created professional-portfolio repository
- Established learning log structure
- Made commitment to baby steps approach

**Key Decision:**
Started fresh instead of continuing with disorganized past work. Clean slate = professional foundation.

**What I Learned:**
- Professional presence starts with proper setup
- Documentation matters from day one
- Small, consistent steps are the path forward

**Challenges:**
- Converting HEIC photo to JPG (solved with online converter)
- Deciding between old account and fresh start (chose fresh start)

**Tomorrow's Goal:**
- Add first project to portfolio
- Document one technical problem and solution
- Make first proper git commit with professional message

**Reflection:**
This is the beginning. Not about perfection, but about consistent progress and documentation.
